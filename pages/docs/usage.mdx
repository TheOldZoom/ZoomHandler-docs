# Usage

This guide will walk you through how to use ZoomHandler in your project.

## Importing ZoomHandler

After installation, import ZoomHandler into your project like this:

```javascript
const { ZoomHandler } = require("zoomhandler");
```

## Creating an Instance

Next, create an instance of the `ZoomHandler` class. You'll need to provide a configuration object with the following properties:

```javascript
new ZoomHandler({
  client, // Your discord client instance
  messageCommandsPath: path.join(__dirname, "commands"), // Path to your command files
  eventsPath: path.join(__dirname, "events"), // Path to your event files
});
```
Make sure that the directory actually exists, or an error will occurs.
