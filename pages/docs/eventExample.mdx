# Events

## Quick info

You must define `eventsPath` in your main file like this:

```js
const { ZoomHandler } = require('zoomhandler');
const path = require("path");

new ZoomHandler({
  client, // Your discord client instance
  eventsPath: path.join(__dirname, "events"), // Path to your event files
});
```

Similarly, to define events, create separate files within the `eventsPath` directory. Each event file should export a function containing the event logic. Here's an example of a ready event:

## The Events
You can use the `ready` event like this:

```javascript
// events/ready.js

module.exports = (client) => {
  client.log.ready(`${client.user.tag} is ready!`);
};
```
or even use the `messageCreate` event like this:

```javascript
// events/messageCreate.js

module.exports = (client, message) => {
  client.log.event(message.content)
};
```
