# Installation

## You can install ZoomHandler via npm:

```bash
npm install zoomhandler
```

Make sure to have discord.js and term-logger so zoomhandler can work properly.

```bash
npm install discord.js term-logger
```

## Install via npx:

```bash
npx create-zoomhandler-app
```
By installing via npx, you will directly get some files to directly start.
